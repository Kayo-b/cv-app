# cv.app
### Creating a CV application page as my first React project.


#### Features:

 - Input fields are rendered in real-time in the CV Preview element;
 - Slick minimalistic styling.


#### Possible future implementations:

 - An option to export the CV as a PDF file.

 #### Technical notes about project development:
 This is my first project using React, the usage of class components instead of function components was deliberate with the purpose of learning how to use and read class components. This code base will be forked and refactored using functional components in the future.
